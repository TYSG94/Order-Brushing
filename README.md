# Order-Brushing

Order brushing is a deceptive technique often associated with e-commerce platforms. 
In this scheme, a seller artificially boosts their own product's ratings and visibility by creating fake orders and fake reviews. 
The goal is to manipulate the appearance of high demand and customer satisfaction, which can attract more genuine buyers. 
Essentially, order brushing involves a seller brushing up their own order numbers by creating fake transactions, without any actual intention of fulfilling those orders. 
This unethical practice can deceive consumers and distort the credibility of product ratings and reviews on online marketplaces.
